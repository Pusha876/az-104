The following is a high level guide on how I created an Azure Managed Identities and Governance project using Azure AD, Azure Logic Apps, Azure Email Service (as part of Logic Apps connector), and Azure Resource Manager:

1. **Create an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Tenant:**
   - Sign in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, click on "Azure Active Directory".
   - Click on "Create a tenant" if you don't have one already.
   - Follow the prompts to create a new Azure AD tenant.

2. **Set up Azure AD Users and Groups:**
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to "Azure Active Directory".
   - Manage users and groups by creating users, groups, and assigning appropriate roles and permissions.

3. **Create Azure Logic App:**
   - In the Azure portal, click on "+ Create a resource" in the upper left-hand corner.
   - Search for "Logic App" and select it from the results.
   - Click on "Create" and follow the prompts to configure your Logic App.
   - Within your Logic App, add the necessary triggers and actions to automate tasks.
   - Use Azure Email Service connector to send emails as needed.

4. **Configure Managed Identities for Logic App:**
   - In your Logic App's designer view, select "Identity" from the menu.
   - Enable system-assigned managed identity for your Logic App.
   - This will create a managed identity for your Logic App, allowing it to authenticate securely with other Azure services.

5. **Set up Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates:**
   - Create ARM templates to define the infrastructure and resources needed for your project.
   - Define resources like Azure Logic Apps, Azure AD resources, etc., in your ARM templates.

6. **Deploy Resources using ARM Templates:**
   - Use Azure Resource Manager to deploy your ARM templates.
   - Navigate to "Resource groups" in the Azure portal.
   - Click on "Add" to create a new resource group.
   - Select your resource group and click on "Deploy" to start deploying your ARM templates.

7. **Configure Access Control using Azure RBAC:**
   - Define roles and assign role-based access control (RBAC) permissions using Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
   - Assign appropriate roles to users and groups to control access to Azure resources.

8. **Monitor and Manage Resources:**
   - Utilize Azure Monitor to track the performance and health of your Azure resources.
   - Set up alerts and notifications to stay informed about any issues.
   - Regularly review and manage access permissions to ensure security and compliance.

# Logic App Workflow Design 

Designing a logic app workflow triggered by a new employee hire involves several steps. Here's a basic outline to get you started:

1. **Identify Trigger**: Determine the event that will trigger the workflow. In this case, it's the hiring of a new employee. You might use a webhook from your HR system or an API call to notify the logic app of the new hire.

2. **Connect to Data Source**: Connect your logic app to the data source where employee information is stored. This could be an HR database, an Excel file in SharePoint, or a cloud-based HR management system like Workday or BambooHR.

3. **Retrieve Employee Information**: Set up actions in your logic app to retrieve the relevant information about the new employee, such as their name, email, department, manager, etc., from the data source.

4. **Process the Information**: Perform any necessary processing on the retrieved information. This might include formatting the data, performing calculations, or applying conditional logic based on certain criteria.

5. **Take Actions**: Based on the processed information, take appropriate actions. For example:
   - Send an email notification to HR staff or the hiring manager to alert them of the new hire.
   - Add the new employee to the company directory or employee database.
   - Generate login credentials and send them to the new employee.
   - Set up accounts for the new employee in various systems or applications they'll need access to.

6. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling and retries to ensure the reliability of the workflow. If any step fails, the logic app should be able to handle the error gracefully, log it for troubleshooting, and possibly retry the action later.

7. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the logic app workflow to ensure that it functions correctly under various scenarios, such as different types of new hires (full-time, part-time, contractor), different departments, etc.

8. **Deployment**: Once you're satisfied with the logic app, deploy it to your production environment. Monitor its performance and make any necessary adjustments based on real-world usage and feedback.

By following these steps, you can design a logic app workflow that is triggered by a new employee hire and efficiently handles the necessary tasks associated with onboarding a new team member.


# Send email to specific mailbox

In Microsoft Azure Logic Apps, to create a workflow that sends an email to a specific mailbox, you typically use the "When an email is received" trigger. This trigger listens for incoming emails in a specified mailbox and then triggers the workflow when a new email arrives. 

Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Create a new Logic App**: If you haven't already, create a new Logic App in the Azure portal.

2. **Add a trigger**: In the Logic App Designer, add the "When an email is received" trigger. You'll need to connect to your email account (such as Outlook, Office 365, or Gmail) and specify the folder where you want to monitor for incoming emails.

3. **Define conditions (optional)**: You can set up conditions to filter emails based on criteria like sender, subject, or body content. This step is optional but can be useful if you only want to trigger the workflow for specific emails.

4. **Add actions**: After the trigger, you can add actions to the workflow. In your case, you would add an action to send an email to the specific mailbox. You can use the "Send an email" action and specify the recipient's email address, subject, and body of the email.

5. **Save and run**: Once you've configured the trigger and actions, save your Logic App and then run it to test the workflow. 

By using the "When an email is received" trigger along with the "Send an email" action, you can create a workflow that automatically sends emails to a specific mailbox whenever new emails are received in the monitored folder.
